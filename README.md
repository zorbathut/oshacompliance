GOOD IDEA: Standing next to a trap as it's being rearmed.

BAD IDEA: Standing *in* a trap as it's being rearmed.

Good news - a recent drop pod included a full manual of OSHA guidelines! It includes things like "stop walking in traps, even if you think they're unarmed". Your colonists have read this book and taken it to heart.

Actually, they burned it all for fuel, except for the one page about traps.

But, that page? They read it.
